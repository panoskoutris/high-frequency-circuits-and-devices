# high-frequency-circuits-and-devices

**High-frequency circuit and device modeling using MATLAB: impedance matching, waveguide material characterization, and antenna array simulations.**

This repository showcases simulation-based analysis of high-frequency systems using MATLAB, covering two core areas:
- **Transmission line and matching network design**
- **Waveguide material estimation and antenna array radiation modeling**

The work was developed as part of an advanced university course in RF/Microwave Engineering and combines analytical techniques, numerical methods, and visualization of electromagnetic behavior.
